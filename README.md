# This project is a cloned project for custom use-case

True-code belongs to [the old repo](https://github.com/babariviere/flutter_sms) which is no longer maintained.

# Secondary Source

[sms_maintained](https://github.com/geordyvcErasmus/flutter_sms) maintained the repo with promising usage, but seems like it is no longer active too.

# More on this

This version of the SMS plugin allows in-app SMS send and receive functionalities. I downgraded the un-essential permission requests for better use experience.
